## AVS File Decoder
This little Javascript aims to read out the file format of Nullsoft's _Advanced Visualization Studio_ and rewrite it as JSON readable by [WebVS](https://github.com/azeem/webvs).

The framework is mostly done now! And the remaining work is adding effects to the decoder.
If you want to help out - cool! Have a look at the top of [js/convert.js](https://github.com/grandchild/AVS-File-Decoder/blob/master/js/convert.js) there is a table with formattings for various effects. Just whip out a hex editor (I can recommend (wxHexEditor)[http://www.wxhexeditor.org/]), open up a preset file, and add a new entry for a missing effect. Make sure you select "generic" as "func"tion value. And then push it this way. Thanks.
